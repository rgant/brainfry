## Additional Configurations

Some configurations of the GCP Firebase project are not supported by Terraform.
To manage Firestore rules, storage rules, and Hosting I will be using `firebase-tools`.

Additionally the Password Policy (which includes the minimum password length for
user accounts among other requirements) and email templates are not currently
supported by Terraform. See [Firebase Manual Config](/docs/firebase-manual-config.md)
document for details on how to manage these.
